# Gitcoin 3.0: The Road to GG24

Author: MathildaDV

We announced a [large shift](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-grants-2025-and-beyond-funding-what-matters-most-in-the-ethereum-ecosystem/20356) within our strategy and vision of Gitcoin, specifically the grants program (which will be our core focus moving forward). Below I aim to outline the roadmap of how we’ll pave the way to GG24. Gitcoin Grants has a renewed focus on “Funding What Matters.” *Where Ethereum funds its foundations and future.*

We no longer build software, so there is blank canvas for anyone to   
We are partnering with allo to build XYZ – in futuer rounds we will partner with the community. 

TL;DR

* Gitcoin 3.0 is focused on Ethereum’s biggest problems.  We are evolving with Dedicated Domain Allocation (DDA) \- matching specific funding mechanisms to distinct problem areas  
* GTC holders will vote on domains for GG24 based on sensemaking analysis and ecosystem validation  
* Each domain gets tailored funding approaches designed by practitioners who understand both the challenges and opportunities  
* A phased approach from sensemaking through retrospective analysis ensures capital flows where it can create maximum impact for Ethereum's future

## Evolution

**Historical Context:** Gitcoin began as a pioneer in Quadratic Funding (QF), dedicated to Ethereum Digital Public Goods and Culture. Our success in scaling QF laid critical groundwork for broader impact from GG1-GG23.

Moving forward, we will continue the work that started with GG23 in expanding the aperture from QF to multi-mechanism. To effectively do so, Gitcoin will enable [Dedicated Domain Allocation](https://www.allo.expert/mechanisms/dedicated-domain-allocation) \- as a router to move capital between.

**Why DDA matters:** Quadratic Funding works for what it was designed for—we've proven that through 23 successful rounds. However, Ethereum's challenges require more than one funding mechanism.  It requires a [practical pluralism](https://medium.com/@owocki/practical-pluralism-322ab0a984c5) of mechanisms. Some problems need patient capital for research, others need quick deployment incentives, and others benefit from retroactive funding for proven impact.  Some problems require a wide network of participants, some require a small band of technocrats to engage.

**What is DDA:** Dedicated Domain Allocation routes capital to where it can have maximum impact. Instead of running a series of QF rounds for everything, we identify Ethereum's biggest challenges, engage domain experts to design appropriate funding approaches, and deploy mechanisms tailored to each problem area.

The concept emerged from Ethereum Foundation [research](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/04/18/ef-report-april-2022) in April 2022 and was popularized through the work of Questbook (most notably with Compound and Arbitrum). We hope to scale it even further with the help of the wider Ethereum Community.

Our approach includes four key components:

1. **Sensemaking:** Rigorous analysis of challenges and opportunities across the Ethereum ecosystem, validated through fundraising potential and community endorsement  
2. **Domain Definition:** Clear boundaries and measurable outcomes for each focus area, ensuring resources are concentrated where they can generate the most impact  
3. **Expert Engagement:** Deep collaboration with proven domain practitioners who understand specific challenges and can design funding approaches  
4. **Tailored Capital Allocation:** Deploying the right mechanism for each domain—from QF to retroactive funding to direct grants to venture-style investments

Gitcoin Grants 2024 (GG24) will implement a structured, five-phase approach to revitalize our impact in the Ethereum ecosystem:

1. **Sensemaking:** Identifying high-impact problem areas through rigorous analysis and validating them through fundraising potential and visibility tests  
2. **Establishing Domains:** Creating specific focus areas through a transparent, community-driven process  
3. **Campaign Design:** Developing targeted funding outcomes tailored to each domain  
4. **Campaign Execution:** Implementing the designed campaigns effectively  
5. **Retrospective Analysis:** Learning from outcomes to improve future rounds

This framework balances structured methodology with practical market validation, ensuring we focus our efforts where we can make the greatest impact while securing the necessary resources and visibility.

### Phasing

**Phase 1:** Sensemaking (May-July 2025\) Identify Ethereum's highest-impact challenges through analysis and ecosystem validation. We'll surface problems with community input and participation where targeted funding can drive meaningful change and secure community endorsement from key ecosystem leaders.

**Phase 2:** Domain Selection (August 2025\) The community chooses priorities. GTC holders vote on 5-6 domains to receive focused resources, with funding allocated proportionally based on community conviction. Think prediction markets for ecosystem priorities.

**Phase 3:** Round Design (August-September 2025\) Domain experts design tailored funding approaches. Each selected domain gets the mechanism that best fits its challenges—QF for community-driven projects, retroactive funding for proven impact, direct grants for research, or hybrid approaches.

**Phase 4:** Coordinated Execution (October 2025\) GG24 launches with synchronized campaigns across all domains. It offers a unified experience for applicants and donors, with real-time support and monitoring throughout the round.

**Phase 5:** Impact Analysis (November 2025\) Measure what worked. Transparent reporting of outcomes, capital efficiency metrics, and community retrospectives that inform our approach for GG25 and beyond.

Call to Action

This represents continued evolution across our history, from pioneering and scaling the concept of novel funding mechanisms to systematic optimization across multiple funding approaches. 

That said, success depends on the community (all of you) throughout the process.

How to get involved:

* Join the sensemaking season starting in June to help identify priority domains  
* Participate in domain selection voting as a GTC holder  
* Apply to serve as a round manager for domains that match your expertise  
* Provide feedback on this roadmap through the comments below

The ecosystem challenges we're addressing require collective intelligence. Your knowledge, connections, and insights influence where capital flows and what gets built.

What domains do you think deserve priority funding? Which funding mechanisms should we experiment with? What ecosystem challenges require urgent attention?

We would love to hear from you. Please drop your thoughts below\!
