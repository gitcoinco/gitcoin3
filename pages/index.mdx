# Gitcoin 3.0: Funding What Matters for Ethereum

**The Single Source of Truth for Gitcoin's Evolution**

---

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Gitcoin 3.0 - a transformative evolution focused on solving Ethereum's biggest problems through innovative capital allocation mechanisms.

## Executive Summary

Gitcoin 3.0 represents a fundamental shift from incremental improvements to a comprehensive reset. Moving beyond traditional quadratic funding, we're implementing **Dedicated Domain Allocation (DDA)** - a sophisticated approach that matches specific funding mechanisms to distinct problem areas where they can have maximum impact.

### Key Transformation Points

- **From Single Mechanism to Multi-Mechanism**: Evolving beyond just Quadratic Funding to embrace multiple funding approaches
- **From General Grants to Domain-Specific Solutions**: Implementing targeted funding for Ethereum's specific challenges
- **From Gitcoin 2.0 to 3.0**: A complete strategic reset after sunsetting Grants Lab and refocusing on core mission
- **From Building Software to Funding Innovation**: Partnering with ecosystem builders rather than developing internal tools

## The Vision: Network-First Funding Festival

Gitcoin 3.0 positions itself as a **Network-First Funding Festival** designed to address Ethereum's biggest problems. This represents:

1. **Schelling Point for Innovation**: Becoming the go-to destination for high-impact Ethereum builders and novel funding experiments
2. **Ecosystem Growth Engine**: Driving sustainable development through strategic capital allocation
3. **Community-Driven Evolution**: Empowering the network to identify and fund what truly matters

## Core Components

### üéØ **Dedicated Domain Allocation**
Strategic distribution of capital across specialized domains using tailored mechanisms for optimal impact.

### üå≥ **Epistemological Framework** 
Grounding decisions in truth through systematic sensemaking about Ethereum's real problems and opportunities.

### üèüÔ∏è **Allo Arenas**
Competitive innovation environments for evolving the best capital allocation mechanisms.

### ü§ù **Community Governance**
Empowering GTC holders and ecosystem participants to guide strategic direction.

## Why This Matters Now

The Ethereum ecosystem faces complex challenges that require sophisticated funding approaches:

- **Developer Retention**: Supporting the career paths of open-source contributors
- **Infrastructure Gaps**: Funding critical but unsexy infrastructure work
- **Adoption Barriers**: Supporting user-facing applications and education
- **Research Needs**: Patient capital for long-term foundational work
- **Global Coordination**: Enabling decentralized ecosystem development

Traditional grant programs struggle with these diverse needs. Gitcoin 3.0's multi-mechanism approach can address each challenge with the appropriate funding strategy.

## The Road to GG24

Our implementation begins with **GG24** (October 2025) - the first round fully implementing the Gitcoin 3.0 vision:

1. **Sensemaking** (May-July): Identifying Ethereum's highest-impact challenges
2. **Domain Selection** (August): Community-driven prioritization of focus areas  
3. **Round Design** (August-September): Expert-designed funding approaches per domain
4. **Execution** (October): Coordinated launch across all domains
5. **Impact Analysis** (November): Measuring outcomes and iterating for the future

## Strategic Pillars

### üîç **Sensemaking First**
Every funding decision must be grounded in deep understanding of real problems and opportunities.

### üéõÔ∏è **Mechanism Pluralism** 
Different problems require different solutions - from QF to retroactive funding to direct grants.

### üåê **Network Effects**
Leveraging the collective intelligence of the Ethereum ecosystem to identify and fund what matters.

### üìä **Evidence-Based Iteration**
Continuous learning and improvement based on transparent measurement of outcomes.
