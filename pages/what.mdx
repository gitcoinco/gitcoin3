# What is Gitcoin 3.0?

**Core Concepts and Definitions**

---

## Vision Statement

**Gitcoin 3.0** is a Network-First Funding Festival focused on solving Ethereum's biggest problems through systematic capital allocation using Dedicated Domain Allocation (DDA) as the core operating model.

## Core Definition

Gitcoin 3.0 represents a fundamental transformation from a single-mechanism grants program to a sophisticated **capital allocation ecosystem** that:

1. **Identifies** Ethereum's highest-impact challenges through systematic sensemaking
2. **Allocates** resources using mechanisms specifically matched to problem domains  
3. **Coordinates** a network of domain experts, builders, and funders
4. **Evolves** through continuous learning and mechanism innovation

## Key Components

### üéØ Dedicated Domain Allocation (DDA)

**Definition**: The strategic, intentional distribution of capital and resources within clearly defined areas of expertise or sectors, leveraging tailored mechanisms to optimally support projects, experts, and initiatives that advance domain-specific outcomes.

**Core Elements**:
- **Sensemaking**: Rigorous analysis of emerging trends, opportunities, and challenges
- **Domain Definition**: Clear boundaries and measurable outcomes for each focus area
- **Expert Engagement**: Deep collaboration with proven domain practitioners
- **Tailored Capital Allocation**: Deploying the right mechanism for each domain

### üå≥ Epistemological Framework

**The Tree of Knowledge for Capital Allocation**

Gitcoin 3.0 uses an epistemological approach to ground decisions in truth rather than speculation:

- **Roots**: Ethereum's biggest unresolved problems (axioms and foundational challenges)
- **Trunk**: Shared framework for exploration (agreed problem spaces)
- **Branches**: Specific domains or theories of change
- **Leaves**: Concrete funding rounds, grants, and outcomes

This framework ensures that funding decisions are based on:
- **Systematic analysis** rather than arbitrary choices
- **Community validation** of problem identification
- **Evidence-based allocation** to highest-impact opportunities

### üèüÔ∏è Network-First Approach

**From Platform to Network**

Unlike traditional grant platforms, Gitcoin 3.0 operates as a **network coordination layer**:

- **Schelling Point**: The go-to destination for high-impact Ethereum builders
- **Permissionless Innovation**: Enabling anyone to propose and test funding mechanisms
- **Competitive Collaboration**: Multiple operators and mechanisms competing and learning
- **Community Ownership**: Distributed governance and decision-making

## Mechanism Pluralism

### Beyond Quadratic Funding

While Gitcoin pioneered Quadratic Funding (QF) in crypto, Gitcoin 3.0 embraces **practical pluralism**:

**Different Problems, Different Solutions**:
- **Quadratic Funding**: Community-driven projects with broad appeal
- **Retroactive Funding**: Proven impact and measurable outcomes
- **Direct Grants**: Specific, milestone-based development
- **Deep Funding**: Complex, long-term research and infrastructure
- **Futarchy**: Prediction-market-based allocation
- **Conviction Voting**: Long-term commitment signaling

**Mechanism Selection Criteria**:
- **Problem Type**: What kind of challenge needs solving?
- **Community Size**: How many stakeholders are involved?
- **Time Horizon**: Short-term deployment vs. long-term research
- **Measurability**: How can success be evaluated?
- **Risk Profile**: Experimental vs. proven approaches

## Operational Model
