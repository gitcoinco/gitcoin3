# Why Gitcoin 3.0?

**Understanding the Need for Transformation**

---

## The End of an Era: Composting Gitcoin 2.0

Gitcoin's journey has unfolded in distinct chapters, each representing different approaches to funding public goods and supporting the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Gitcoin 1.0 (2017-2021): The Pioneer Era
- **Centralized company** with a clear mission: funding what matters
- Built bounties, hackathons, grants, and other funding infrastructure
- **$60M+ distributed** across thousands of projects
- Pioneered **Quadratic Funding** in the crypto space
- Created the foundation for decentralized public goods funding

### Gitcoin 2.0 (2021-2025): The Decentralization Experiment

Gitcoin 2.0 represented an ambitious experiment with decentralization:

- **Multiple business lines**: Grants Stack, Public Works, Passport, Allo Protocol, KERNEL
- **DAO governance** with complex workstream structures
- **Expansion beyond Ethereum** to multiple chains and ecosystems
- **Innovation in funding mechanisms** beyond just Quadratic Funding

#### What Worked in Gitcoin 2.0
- Successfully spun out **Gitcoin Passport** (now part of HumanProtocol)
- Created the **Allo Protocol** for modular capital allocation
- Pioneered **multi-mechanism funding** approaches
- Built strong **community relationships** and governance practices
- Demonstrated **network-native coordination** capabilities

#### What Didn't Work in Gitcoin 2.0

**Product-Market Fit Challenges**
> "My biggest lesson from Gitcoin 2.0? Product-market fit trumps everything. We built impressive governance structures and community engagement, but struggled to ship working software that people genuinely needed." - Kevin Owocki

**Overengineering and Complexity**
- Byzantine frameworks that didn't serve real purposes
- Over-planning without sufficient community participation
- Complex governance structures that slowed decision-making
- Attempts to revolutionize both product and governance simultaneously

**Financial Sustainability Issues**
- **Revenue vs. Burn**: ~$1M/year revenue vs. ~$3M/year expenses
- Market downturn impact on treasury and operational capacity
- Grants Lab expenses exceeding revenue significantly
- Difficulty achieving self-sustaining business models

**Focus Dilution**
> "We became enamored with regenerative economics, theory-heavy governance models, and abstract visions of systems changeâ€”while our core competency was always connecting open source developers with funding." - Kevin Owocki

## Market Context: Why Change Now?

### The Ethereum Ecosystem Has Evolved

**New Coordination Primitives**
- Proliferation of funding mechanisms beyond QF
- Emergence of retroactive funding models (RetroPGF, Deep Funding)
- Sophisticated DAO tooling and governance systems
- Multiple players entering the public goods funding space

**Changing Needs**
- More sophisticated problems requiring targeted solutions
- Need for **mechanism pluralism** rather than one-size-fits-all approaches
- Requirements for **domain expertise** in funding allocation
- Demand for **measurable impact** and accountability

**Competitive Landscape**
- New entrants in the public goods funding space
- L2 ecosystems developing their own funding programs
- Need for Gitcoin to maintain relevance and leadership

### Lessons from the Bear Market

The crypto bear market provided crucial insights:

1. **Revenue models matter**: Grant programs need sustainable funding mechanisms
2. **Community resilience**: Strong communities can weather market downturns
3. **Focus is critical**: Spreading resources too thin reduces impact
4. **Quality over quantity**: Better to do fewer things excellently than many things poorly

## The Call for Gitcoin 3.0

### Strategic Imperatives

**1. Return to Core Mission**
- Refocus on **funding what matters** for Ethereum
- Leverage proven expertise in **open source software** funding
- Build on **deep community relationships** and trust

**2. Embrace Mechanism Pluralism**
- Move beyond QF-only approach to **multi-mechanism funding**
- Match **funding mechanisms to problem types**
- Enable **domain-specific optimization**

**3. Achieve Financial Sustainability**
- Develop **"fair fee" models** for self-sustaining operations
- Create **value capture** mechanisms that align with mission
- Ensure **long-term viability** beyond market cycles

**4. Leverage Network Effects**
- Position as **schelling point** for Ethereum funding
- Enable **permissionless innovation** in funding mechanisms
- Foster **competitive collaboration** among ecosystem builders

### The Opportunity

Gitcoin 3.0 represents an opportunity to:

- **Lead** the evolution of public goods funding
- **Define** best practices for mechanism selection and domain allocation
- **Create** sustainable models for ecosystem development
- **Demonstrate** the power of community-driven coordination

## Theoretical Foundation: Assembly Theory

The transformation to Gitcoin 3.0 is grounded in **Assembly Theory** - the understanding that complex systems emerge through purposeful combination of simpler components.

### Key Principles

**Modular Composition**
- Funding mechanisms as **composable building blocks**
- Ability to **combine and recombine** approaches for different contexts
- **Systematic exploration** of the design space

**Purposeful Evolution**
- **Guided processes** rather than random experimentation
- **Feedback loops** for continuous improvement
- **Constraints as guidance** for effective development

**Incremental Complexity**
- Building from **simple, functional foundations**
- **Iterative development** rather than complete redesigns
- **Evidence-based advancement** through each complexity level

## The Epistemological Imperative

Gitcoin 3.0 is built on the principle that **funding decisions must be grounded in truth**:

### The Problem with Arbitrary Allocation
- Many funding programs lack **systematic analysis** of real problems
- Decisions based on **politics or narratives** rather than evidence
- **Resource waste** through poor targeting

### The Solution: Systematic Sensemaking
- **Rigorous analysis** of Ethereum's biggest challenges
- **Community validation** of problem identification
- **Evidence-based allocation** to highest-impact opportunities

## Looking Forward: The Promise of Gitcoin 3.0

### Vision Statement
> "Gitcoin 3.0 positions itself as the premier capital allocator for solving Ethereum's biggest problems in an increasingly networked world; a networked complement to the hierarchical Ethereum Foundation."

### Success Metrics

**Relevance**
- Reestablish importance to **key opinion leaders (KOLs)**
- Become the **default destination** for builders seeking funding
- Maintain **thought leadership** in public goods funding

**Software Quality**
- Build **cutting-edge, high-quality** on-chain capital allocation software
- Achieve **5x quality and velocity** at 1/5 the cost through decentralized networks
- Prevent **monopoly capture** through competitive mechanisms

**GTC Utility & Longevity**
- Enhance **Gitcoin's relevance** to Ethereum funders
- Create **sustainable value** for GTC holders
- Establish **competitive, financially sustainable** models
